## Content of the repo and instructions


### .ipynb nootebook
The notebook is a standalone, the whole project is explained and implemented on it, including the GoogleBenchmark study at the end.


### cppFiles (old)
- challenge2.cpp
- challenge3.cpp
- select.cpp

These cpp files are old versions of the project, select.cpp is the final one. The single files are standalone: they contain main and all used functions. 
_No classes where used in this project 'cause the final goal was to achieve a given trashold in terms of Google Benchmark perfomance_
It is possible to simply compile with any standard compiler, inly standard libraries of c++  where used.
